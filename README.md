## Description

Basically the focus was on map() function and how to divide a task into components and then importing and working on them rather than hard coding.
This project is a simple Airbnb-inspired application built with React. 
It showcases a collection of various experiences, complete with images, descriptions, and pricing. 
The goal is to simulate a listing feature similar to what one might find on a vacation rental platform.

- **Responsive Design**: The application is mobile-friendly, ensuring a seamless user experience across devices.
- **Dynamic Data Rendering**: Experience listings are rendered dynamically using data from a JavaScript file (`data.js`).
- **Image Integration**: Each experience features an image to enhance visual appeal.

## Technologies Used

- **React**: For building user interfaces.
- **JavaScript**: Utilizing modern JavaScript features.
- **CSS**: For styling the application.
- **HTML**: For structuring the application.
